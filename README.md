# ResearchProject

 Today’s educational system has evolved from fact-based learning to problem solving based learning. Students are inclining towards innovation and creativity.
 A large influx of students is seen in computer programming in which the computational thinking is the main foundation.
 Computational thinking is defined as a problem-solving strategy that involves expressing problems and their solutions such that computer could execute. 
 It requires student to understand the given set of problem statement and generate the solution in computer programming language.
 Providing the students with the timely feedback for their solutions can improve the student’s understanding of the concepts. 
 This can be done by analysing the intermediate steps of the student generated solutions. 
 The sequence of programming snapshots may be collected and analysed in real time for the purposes of tailoring instruction.
 
 The research project “Early prediction in block-based learning environment” emphasis on providing the K-12 students with enhanced experiential learning. 
 It employs data mining and machine learning techniques into student generated solutions of given problems. 
 It generates valuable information that helps systems to provide continuous assistance.
 The procedure involved three experiments. In experiment 1 the data was prepared for machine learning algorithm by character encoding and semantic encoding technique.
 In character encoding sequential characters in pairs of one, two and three where extracted while in semantic encoding the characters extracted where meaningful tokens in sequential order and performance was compared.  
 
 Experiment 2 varied the size of window in which 5 contiguous edits and 10 contiguous intermediate edits, that were made to reach the final solution, by students where combined.
 In third experiment model performance was evaluated for the data that was prepared. 
 The findings suggest that students who need assistance are likely to receive it as a result of early prediction made by the model. 
 However, those that do not require any form of assistance may be presented with the instructional content that is not necessary to improve learning and performance. 
 
 The findings will help the current educational system to improve its performance.
 It will provide them assistance through insights such as how likely the student is going to succeed for the given problem.
 It will help systems to give hints to the students while they are on their quest for solving a problem. 
 The insight generated will also help the systems to dynamically allocate the next task based on a student’s current competency level.  
 Thus, research has great potential to be further extended and improve the current educational system.
